			<p>HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US</p>
			<p>
				<div>How deep the Father's love for us,</div>
				<div>How vast beyond all measure</div>
				<div>That He should give His only Son,</div>
				<div>To make a wretch His treasure</div>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<div>How great the pain of searing loss,</div>
				<div>The Father turns His face away</div>
				<div>As wounds which mar the chosen One,</div>
				<div>Bring many sons to glory</div>			
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<div>Behold the Man upon a cross,</div>
				<div>My sin upon His shoulders</div>
				<div>Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,</div>
				<div>Call out among the scoffers</div>						
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<div>It was my sin that held Him there,</div>
				<div>Until it was accomplished</div>
				<div>His dying breath has brought me life,</div>
				<div>I know that it is finished</div>				
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<div>I will not boast in anything,</div>
				<div>No gifts, no power, no wisdom</div>
				<div>But I will boast in Jesus Christ,</div>
				<div>His death and resurrection</div>				
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<div><i>Chorus:</i></div>
				<div>Why should I gain from His reward?</div>
				<div>I cannot give an answer.</div>
				<div>But this I know with all my heart</div>				
				<div>His wounds have paid my ransom.</div>				
				<div><i>(repeat)</i></div>
