			<p>IN CHRIST ALONE</p>
			<p>
				<div>In Christ alone, my hope is found.<div>
				<div>He is my light, my strength, my song;</div>
				<div>This cornerstone, this solid ground,</div>
				<div>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.</div>
				<div>What heights of love, what depths of peace.</div>			
				<div>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease;</div>			
				<div>My Comforter, my All in all,</div>			
				<div>Here in the love of Christ I stand.</div>			
			</p>
			<br/ >
			<p>
				<div>In Christ alone, who took on flesh,</div>
				<div>Fullness of God in helpless babe;</div>
				<div>This gift of love and righteousness,</div>
				<div>Scorned by the ones He came to save.</div>
				<div>Till on that cross as Jesus died,</div>			
				<div>The wrath of God was satisfied.</div>
				<div>For ev'ry sin on Him was laid,</div>
				<div>Here in the death of Christ I live.</div>
			</p>
			<br/ >
			<p>
				<div>There in the ground His body lay,</div>
				<div>Light of the world by darkness slain;</div>
				<div>Then bursting forth in glorious day,</div>
				<div>Up from the grave He rose again!</div>
				<div>And as he stands in victory,</div>
				<div>Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;</div>
				<div>For I am His, and He is mine,</div>
				<div>Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</div>				
			</p>
			<br/ >
			<p>
				<div>No guilt in life, no fear in death,</div>
				<div>This is the pow'r of Christ in me.</div>
				<div>From life's first cry, to final breath,</div>
				<div>Jesus commands my destiny.</div>
				<div>No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,</div>
				<div>Can ever pluck me from his hand.</div>
				<div>'Till He returns, or calls me home,</div>
				<div>Here in the love of Christ, I'll stand.</div>
